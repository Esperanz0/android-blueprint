**A starting point for my Android apps**  
This is a starting point when starting an Android project. It includes:  
* Standard initial gradle configuration
* Inital neccessary files
* Model-View-Presenter design base
* Android Support Testing dependencies
* .... (Updated following my personal best practices for Android developement) 

**How to use**  

`git clone` this repository to set it as a starting point for an Android project. It reduces the setup time.
